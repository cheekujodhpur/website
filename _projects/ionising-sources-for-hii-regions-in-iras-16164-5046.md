<p>In this project, we use observations of IRAS 16164-5046 in 1280 MHz band of GMRT, to try
to find the exact spectral type of the OB stars which are candidate ionising sources for HII
regions in the observed area. This would give us an idea about what stage of star formation
they are in. Comparing this to the environment, we can deduce parts of the full story of star
formation. Based on the morphology of HII regions, we can deduce star formation related
events that occurred/are occurring in the region.</p>

<p><i>I am sorry but I cannot reveal more information about this as of writing, since my colleagues 
from this project are aiming for a publication from the results.</i> However, you can enjoy a draft of the radio map of the region in 1280 MHz.</p>
