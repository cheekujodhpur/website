<p>This project aims to reproduce the results of [Xuan Luo’s Pepper’s Cone paper](https://roxanneluo.github.io/papers/PeppersCone/Pepper_s_Cone_UIST_2017.pdf). This is presented as an inexpensive DIY display. It works on the principle of Pepper’s Ghost i.e. we simultaneously see a reflection of the image displayed on the screen with the background, which results in a perception of a floating 3D image.</p>

<p>Setting aside the author's Unity code for an iPad Pro, we wrote our own code using WebVR for pose detection and ThreeJS for rendering the mesh, as well as calibration code in OpenCV. You can find all of this in our [repository](http://github.com/cheekujodhpur/peppers-cone).</p>

<p>Thanks to <em>Sourav Bose</em> for working with me on this project and <em>Prof. Parag Chaudhuri</em> and <em>Manish Goregaonkar</em> for their guidance.</p>
