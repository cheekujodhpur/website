								<h2>Magic is a myth, magicians not.</h2>
                                <p>
                                My magical staff is called an undergraduate degree in Physics. It is embedded with various power gems; I am a part of the National Astronomy Olympiad programme, and have worked on a few astronomy projects. I have done freelance web development and undergraduate research in computer graphics. Additionally, I managed the <a style="display:inline-block" href="https://wncc-iitb.org/">Web and Coding Club</a> at IIT Bombay. These days I am an everyday data scientist.
