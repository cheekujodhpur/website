### Best in Fiction
#### [The Brothers Karamazov](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4934.The_Brothers_Karamazov)
##### by Fyodor Dostoevsky

This is a classic, and it is probably not the most entertaining piece of fiction I've consumed in 2023, but it is quite memorable. Despite long monologues at certain places, the book will keep you hooked. There is a murder and there is a mystery.

### Best in Memoir
#### [Down the Drain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123183412-down-the-drain)
##### by Julia Fox

Iconic and inspiring.
Typically, I tend to find inspiration in voyagers, explorers and entrepreneurs. But what drives inspiration is sheer determination and will against all adversity. Julia's story has that.
More than that, it is quite an entertaining book. She is a great storyteller.

### Best in Textbook
#### [Causal Inference for the Brave and True](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58898489-causal-inference-for-the-brave-and-true)
##### by Matheus Facure

I am on the causality wagon since last year.
This is an e-book with code snippets and visualisations.
It is also quite concise, which helps.
<br />
**Most memorable idea**: Linear regression is your best friend.

### Best in Non-Fiction
#### [The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61714633-the-wager)
##### by David Grann

As the subtitle goes, a tale of shipwreck and mutiny. This would make a great suspense thriller. Another great example of how reality is much more juicier than fiction.
