My name is Kumar Ayush, and my acquaintances call me Ayush. You should imagine, and we have reached the point in this article where you should consider keeping your imagination open; what would be a frequent topic of discussion if Hrithik Roshan is meeting someone for the first time? They do a handshake, and the poor fellow has to explain the appendage sooner or later. My life is similar. Sooner or later, after my first conversation with most people, I have to explain why it is so that my "first" name is not my "given" name.

Now imagine, and this should be easy because I asked you five sentences ago to open your creative mind; if this is a repeating question, I should have a well-rehearsed answer. But this is where you are wrong, my friend. I don't have one, but multiple well-rehearsed answers. If the counterparty is a European person, I explain to them that this is a double first name, like Mary-Anne, but as a matter of convention, my parents skipped the hyphen. Now, as double names go, you can say the entire thing, but if you want to avoid bothering with it, go with the second part. If the counterparty is an Indian person, the answer depends on my judgement of the counterparty's understanding of Indian geography and political history.

You see, skipping a family name is quite common in Bihar(my parents are Biharis). The urban legend is that this practice became common during the JP movement as a protest against the caste system. There are a few standard templates, such as Kumar X, Kumari X, X Jyoti, X Bharti, and X Suman. While the later options imply that the "first" name is the "given" name, it does not imply that the "last" name is the "family" name.

Names aren't real, or well, they are certainly not single-dimensional. They are almost a legal construct, but in legal realism, you may get away with variations in Romanised versions of your vernacular name. They are a looser construct than your national or tax identification numbers. Suppose you're of Marathi or Gujarati origin. In that case, you will find it familiar that your name looks something like [Given Name] [Father's Given Name] [Family Name]. And in spite, you will fill out forms in your life that will skip the "middle" name. This is noteworthy because this polymorphic characteristic is invalid for other properties associated with your identity, such as age, sex and nationality. I recommend this w3 i18n document on [personal names worldwide](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names). This is a must-read if you directly interface or work on a system that interfaces with humans from diverse cultural backgrounds.

They have several other dimensions, which are a representation of the multiplicity of our identities. Writers have pen names, and artists have stage names. I have three names, my parents and paternal family calls me Nishu, and a few of my friends and my maternal family calls me Cheeku. They are not even diminutives of my "legal" name. While researching for this article, I found that Wikipedia has a proper page on [Bengali name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_name). This concept of "good name" and "nickname" or "pet name" is entirely different and is not isolated to the Bengalis on the Indian subcontinent. It's practically true for my entire family (Biharis) and also anecdotally common in other parts. 

Indeed, the "good" names sound more scholarly, often plucked out of literature or mythology, whereas the "pet" names may sound like the names you would give your pets. People have names for their houses, their ships, and their cars. This extends to brand names in modern society. It is trivial that they are part of any entity's identity, but all the cultural connotations are non-trivial. Names remind you of loved ones long gone. They are anchor points in our consciousness. I will not tolerate a friend named Shahrukh without thinking of the SRK. We name our public places after our famous leaders because we do not want to anchor their ideologies into discourse. 

They also have prophetical connotations, not just staring into the present from the past but also into the future. Start with the Urban Dictionary meaning of your name. I am flattered by [these](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ayush). Please send me your favourite ones for your name. There is also an abbreviation expansion in there- A for Amazing, Y for Young and so on. Have you played the Flames love compatibility game, where you apply some mumbo jumbo algorithm on letters of your and your crush' name? There is also numerology and all sorts of astrology deviants associated with your name. I've never understood it. Apart from the pseudoscience in deriving a prediction from a name, the input itself is not apparent. Which of a person's many names would you use?

There are connotations involving agency, even. Knowing the name of something gives you power over it is a concept that has been present in various cultures and belief systems throughout history. Naming something can give you control (or the illusion thereof) over the named object or entity.

I always like to muse over details of all such meanings of a name, for a person, for my future offspring, for a brand to be and so on. Even when you look at the names of other folks, trying to reimagine the naming process itself is fascinating.

Disclaimer: From this point onwards, we give more weightage to humour than factual correctness. Don't write me angry letters.

One of my close friends is named Anuj because he is the younger of two brothers. But the elder brother's name Siddhanth does not mean an elder brother. The parents did not retcon!

My maternal grandfather (nana) is Laxman, the second youngest of four brothers named Ram, Laxman, Shatrughan and Bharat. You can imagine they started with Ram and included Laxman trivially, but Shatrughan is surely a bet? It would suck to not complete the set!

Mythological siblings are a great inspiration for names, always. Zeus, Poseidon and Hades work for three brothers because you can try loving one of them the least and get a chance to test out the theory that they'd turn out spiteful but an achiever nonetheless.

If you have step-sons, you can aim for Castor and Pollux, the Gemini twins. There's a definite hierarchy among them. Pollux is immortal, and the constellation has its feet dipped into Milky Way Galaxy as an artistic portrayal of an indisputable fact.

If you have a set of girls, you can do Sara, Lara, Yara, Mara, Fara(h), etc. These display variations in languages, culture and history, with syllables easy to pronounce for most humans. I am generally not a fan of more than two syllables. I like my human names as I like my variable names, crisp and concise.

There are good options among Pandavas and Kauravas. Nakul and Sahdeva for non-identical twins is a winner. Despite the later legacy, Suyodhan and Sushasan are great options. You can call them Duroydhan and Dushasan on their naughty days. As these are names from mythology and legends, we accept that they break the rule of fewer syllables. But now, you must be careful about what unappealing nicknames you're inspiring. 

Let's do Greek! You could go with Pythagoras, Eratosthenes, Hercules or Orion, and if you're feeling particularly cruel, Diogenes and Sisyphus are not that far up the alley. No one except those who do the paperwork must use the long forms, and no one likes those people anyway.

We go back to Indian mythology but raise the bar on our spelling and pronunciation skills. How about Ashwathama, Ghatotkach and his sons - Barbarik, Anjanaparvan and Meghavarna? I am also fond of a few Deccan ones - Devarakonda or Shatavahana.

There's an incredible depth of culture and conversation in picking such names. In mythology, Ashwathama cried like a horse when he was born, so his name means "that whose voice is like a horse". You can hit the jackpot if you wait a couple of years before officially naming your kid. You can optimise for behavioural and physical traits.

You do not have to restrict your imagination to the past. There exists modern mythology, aka fantasy. I would be open to Frodo or Isildur, or others from the Malazan universe. They have colourful nicknames based on traits such as Vastly Blank, but also tolerable nicks, which can be used as official names - Hedge and Fiddler. Another of my favourites is the Red Rising series by Pierce Brown, where they do Roman-inspired names. You can end anything with the suffix -us! Call me Kumarus or Cheekus from tomorrow, please!

Let us come back to reality and ponder upon historical figures. Why can't Einstein or Gandhi be good first names? There's a greater risk of controversy when you use real people, though. Modern standards are often applied to the not-so-modern world. But the reality is not just homo sapiens. We also have the plant kingdom. Let's do Honey, Cinnamon, Cardamom, Cumin, Asafoetida and Ginger, Pumpkin and Potato, Tomato and Zucchini, Lemon and Pears.

This is an endless exercise, but I am committed to it. Please don't refrain from sending me your idea.
