I moved to Dubai recently for work, and one of my ventures here has been to find the best coffee. This was not as deliberate as it was coincidental. I decided to try a fancy-looking cafe close to my office. I liked the drink so much that I tried multiple other cafes to ensure my earlier judgement was not an overreaction. After a couple of weeks, trying out the coffee at a new place has become a habit. Thus, I wonder why not document all the cafes I've tried.
