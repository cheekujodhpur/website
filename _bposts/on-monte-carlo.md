[Eric Veach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Veach) wrote his thesis on ["Robust Monte Carlo Methods for Light Transport Simulation"](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/veach_thesis/thesis-bw.pdf). This is a famous piece of work, considered a groundbreaking work in rendering and ubiquitous among graphics researchers and professionals. On page 12, there is a sentence which reads
</p>
<blockquote>
The principle of Monte Carlo methods is not that the samples are truly random, but that random samples could be used in their place.
</blockquote>
<p>
It took me some time to understand what he means, and I am still not sure if I have interpret it well, but pay attention to the following piece of code, using two slightly different functions to compute the value of $\pi$ and see if you see my point.

<p>The true value of $\pi$ upto 5 decimal places is $3.14159$.</p>
