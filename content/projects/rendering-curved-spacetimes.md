<p>We have observed Einstein rings around massive objects in deep space. Interstellar also gave us a view of an accretion disk around a supernatural blackhole. But what if we had a black hole inside a small room?</p>

<p>We modify <a href="http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/">Kevin Beason's smallpt</a> to handle curved ray trajectories and generate images of the Cornell box with a Schwarzschild black hole inside it. The work was selected as poster at ACM SIGGRAPH '17 and also a Semi-Finalist for the ACM Student Research Competition.</p>
