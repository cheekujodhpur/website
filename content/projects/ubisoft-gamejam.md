<p>About 20 students were selected to visit Ubisoft Pune office for a 24 hour gamejam. The theme was <i>water</i>, and we came up with a platformer game.</p>

<p>I wrote the game engine in JavaScript from scratch and the artwork is originally created by <em>Bidish Ghosh</em> but this left us with little time to work on the game dynamics. There is not more to describe here but you can play the game <a href="/media/ubisoft-gamejam/">here</a>; lightweight and runs in almost any browser.</p>
<p>Thanks to <em>Sarthak Khandelwal</em>, <em>Bidish Ghosh</em> and <em>Yashwardhan Didwania</em> for working with me on this project.</p>
