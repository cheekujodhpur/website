excerpt: >-
  <p>We made a webcam spectrograph using an optical CD as the diffraction
  grating as our course project for Waves, Oscillation and Optics (EP 226). As
  processing the camera images on a computer would be too boring, we used an RPi
  board with embedded camera which we happened to have. The RPi could process
  and transmit the data over WiFi enabling us to access the results from any
  computer, in principle. This made the spectrograph completely portable.</p>

<p>Our professor suggested many possible improvements onto this which would make it a cheap product for schools. They include distancing the grating from the camera and using a good grating rather than the CD which has curved grooves.</p>
