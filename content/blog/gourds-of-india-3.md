Following up on [Nenua Kadala](/blog/gourds-of-india-2/), I am going to focus on Lauki Chana Dal in this post. This is perhaps one of the most common gourd recipes in India.
Lauki, which is bottle gourd, is the most commonly used gourd as well. My wife described it as a good middle ground between cucumber and pumpkin. It has good moisture content but more volume than a cucumber, and a thick skin such that it doesn't rot fast. It has a more neutral texture than pumpkin so it can be used in a variety of recipes, even desserts!
Chana Dal also holds a special place because it goes well with both rice and bread, from Dal Tadka to Dal Fry.

This is quite simple to cook, you just add diced lauki with chana dal in pressure cooker. Then you temper it as you like.
